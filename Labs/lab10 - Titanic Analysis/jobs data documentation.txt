Description: 

Dataset of reported occupations in the United States Labor Force from 1850-2000. The data is originally from the United States Census Bureau and was provided by the University of Minnesota Population Center (ipums.org).

The categorization scheme used was devised in 1950. As a result, some category names may seem outdated and more modern occupations may be missing.

Data for the 1890 census is missing. Also, some categories suffer from missing data in 1940, in which case you may notice some steep drops for that year.
